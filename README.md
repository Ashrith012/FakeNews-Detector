# FakeNews-Detection using NLP

# Overview
This project implements a Fake News Detection System using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a Naive Bayes-based algorithm. The system analyzes news articles for patterns such as the presence of quotes, verbs, and named entities to classify them as either Real News or Fake News.

# Features
* Admin Login: Secure access for administrators to manage the system. <br/>
* News Document Upload: Upload news articles for evaluation. <br/>
* Fake News Detector Algorithm: <br/>
    * Extracts quotes, verbs, and named entities.<br/>
    * Applies a Naive Bayes algorithm to calculate a Fake Rank Score.<br/>
* Classification Results: Displays detection results with corresponding scores.<br/>

# Technologies Used
* Backend: Django <br/>
* NLP Libraries:<br/>
   * TextBlob<br/>
   * NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)<br/>
* Frontend: HTML, CSS<br/>
* File Handling: Django's FileSystemStorage<br/>

# How It Works
- 1 Upload News Document: Users can upload a text document containing news articles.
- 2 Processing and Analysis:
   - Detects quotes, verbs, and named entities using NLP.
   - Calculates a Fake Rank Score for each article based on these features.
- 3 Classification:
    - Articles with a score > 0.90 are classified as "Real News."
    - Articles with a score â‰¤ 0.90 are classified as "Fake News."
- 4 Results Display: The analysis results are presented in a tabular format.
